        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I’m currently an architect but have been thinking about changing careers for some time. And since I’ve always been curious about programming I though that now would be a good time to do so, to learn new skills and acquire knowledge in that broad field. At first, I had to research about what area of programming would be satisfying for me, trying to situate myself in such a vast and brave new world. Given my professional background, I found that Web/App Development could be the right way to go, since it combines a visual, presentational side with the abstractness inherent to programming. I’m excited to begin this new venture and hope I learn a lot along the way!</p>
